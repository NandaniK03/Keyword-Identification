INTRODUCTION:

This python code extracts keywords from data scraped from a webpage. It then analyzes and visualizes the extracted keywords.

CODE DESCRIPTION:

Libraries used :

`requests` for making FTTP requests
`beautifulsoup` for web scrapping
`yake` for keyword extraction
`wordcloud` for data visualization
`matplotlib` for data visualization

1. Web Scraping:
- scrape the text from webpage using `beautifulsoup`

2. Data Storage:
- store the scraped text in a text file

3. Data Preprocessing:
- preprocess the data by lower casing each word

4. Keyword Extraction:
- extract most relevant keywords using `yake`
- store the extracted keywords and correspoding scores as tuples in a list

5. Data Visualization:

a. Bar plot:
- make a horizontal bar plot to accomodate keywords without overlapping of letters
Scores on x axis and Keywords on y axis

b. Word Cloud Generation:
- generate a word cloud using the scores from `yake`
- using wordcloud library

Graphs and plots :

1. Horizontal bar plot: Extracted Keywords vs Relevance Scores 
2. Wordcloud : Relevant Keywords visuals
